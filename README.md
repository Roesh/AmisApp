# AmisApp
A 3D picture matching game for whose pictures and names are customizable for Windows

Setup
=

To change the pictures and names that the game displays do the following:
- Go into folder AmisApp_Data/AddedResources. NOTE: 9 images are needed
- In this folder, you will find a names.txt text file, and various image files

The names in the .txt file are in a specific order: 
- The first four names correspond to images that are LANDSCAPE, the next 4 are PORTRAIT
- The 9th image is a LANDSCAPE image
- To modify the names and images, replace the current names with the needed names, and replace the images with the needed images. Make sure that the image filesâ€™ names are identical to the typed names in the names.txt file. Also make sure that the first four names are landscape and next four are portrait
- Use ONLY .jpg or .jpeg file extensions for the images. The optimal ratio of length:width for each image is 2:3
