History and Notes
=

This app evolved from a prototype of a game I created for my friends. The original game had 8 hardcoded images, each of which was a picture of me with one of my friends from school. These images were the inspiration behind this improved version's name: Amis. Amis app includes several improvements over the first game: 
- UI options to quit, go to login screen, and view the animation of image without needing to complete the game
- The ability to pull images from a website (for a time)
- Android build (deprecated, worked based on the website)

I made the mistake of hardcoding the url of a free hosting website for the "online" component of the game. The "Username" entered here corresponded to a directory I created on the server. This has the same file structure as the local "added resources" folder. I need to update the url in the game at some point to look at my new linux server.

Pic orbit is the next step in the evolution of this series of image display application. It emphasizes the showcase elements of the games that preceded, removing the "game" element. It supports the display of any number of images, of any ratio and supports both png and jpg file formats concurrently.
